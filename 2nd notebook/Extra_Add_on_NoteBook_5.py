Task to be coded :
Try downloading the entire set of data files with a for loop. The code below contains the entire set of code for web scraping the NY MTA turnstile data.
"""


# Import libraries
import requests
import urllib.request

# Set the URL you want to webscrape from
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'

# Connect to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup object
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

print(len(soup.findAll('a')))   


# To download the whole data set, let's do a for loop through all a tags
# for i in range(36,len(soup.findAll('a'))+1): #'a' tags are for links
# avoid looping their are too many data files. may take around 2-3 hrs

one_a_tag = soup.findAll('a')[100]
link = one_a_tag['href']
